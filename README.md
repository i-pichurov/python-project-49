Install the package using the command in the Makefile:
    
    make package-install

After installing the package, you can run the games with the following commands:

    brain-even
    brain-calc
    brain-gcd
    brain-progression
    brain-prime

# Objective of the game: 

|game  | objective  |
| ------------ | ------------ |
|brain-even   | determine whether a number is even  |
| brain-calc   |  evaluate the result of an expression |
| brain-gcd  | find the greatest common divisor  |
|    brain-progression |  calculate missing number in progression |
|    brain-prime |  determine if a number is prime |
